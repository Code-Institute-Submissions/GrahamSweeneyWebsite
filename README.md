# CI-Project1
## Intro
This repo is the source code for an artist's business website.
- The artist, Graham Sweeney, required a website where his followers could find information, listen to videos, and view images.

## Functionality
- After consulting with Graham, it was established that the site should be a **one-page, scrolling format**.
- Each page **section** of the code represents a standalone page.


## Technologies
- The website was developed using front-end technologies utilizing **HTML, CSS and Javascript.**
- The [Twitter bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) was incorporated fo CSS layouts.

## Version control
- Git and GitHub were utilized for **version control.** As additions and edits were being made, files were committed to branches and merged to the master branch.

## Deployment
- Development and master/production branches were deployed on the [Netlify](https://netlify.com) platform.
- This enabled deployments to be triggered from **GitHub** commits to a dev branch.
- Once changes to dev were tested and approved, theses were **merged to the master branch** and made publicly available on [Graham's website](https://grahamsweeney.ie).

## Testing
- The site was tested on all modern browsers to ensure cross compatibility and functionality.
- The site was also tested to be responsiveness and to ensure it would be correctly displayed across mobile devices.
