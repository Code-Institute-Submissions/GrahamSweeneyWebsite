## UX

- Each page **section** of the code represents a standalone page of what would be a regular multi=page website.

#### Section 1/Header: 
- Visitors should be greeted with a large full-width cover image.
- A video should be available to play in a modal window at the top of the page.
- Links to Graham's social media profiles should be available.

#### Section 2: 
- An introduction should contain some brief details on Graham and his background.
- Some quotes regarding Graham from other famous artists should be displayed.
- Several small images taken from Graham's instagram posts.

#### Section 3:
- Display an inline list of several music video's. These video's are embedded from YouTube.

#### Section 4: 
- A further biography section to include further information on Graham, his activities etc.

#### Footer:
- Contain social profile links.
