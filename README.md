# CI-Project1
Frontend-only website using the technologies learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development module on Code Institute.net


## Project guidelines:
- Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
- Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
- Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
- Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
- We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
- The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
- You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.
- Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
- Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
- Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

### Smooth Scroll with jQuery
---
jQuery can also do this. Here's the code to perform a smooth page scroll to an anchor on the same page. It has some logic built in to identify those jump links, and not target other links.
